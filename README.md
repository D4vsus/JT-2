# JT-2

A terminal emulator programed in java.

---

## Set Up
Because this terminal is made in java, the only thing you need to worry is to have the JVM
and the jar which is the runnable.

In the bin folder you'll find the runnable and the configuration file
with all the information of how to configure in the README.md of the file

---

## How to use
You just need to write the direction of the program, and the work with it.

---

## Working in it
The terminal still at work, so some stuff such us the command record are in development.
